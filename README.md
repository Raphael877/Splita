Splita is a digital Ajo platform that allows users to save, pool money, and contribute in groups. Essentially, it modernizes the traditional community savings system into a secure, mobile-first app.

Users can create groups (or join existing ones).

Each group has a cycle where members contribute a set amount periodically.

Contributions are rotated so that each member gets a turn to receive the pooled funds.
